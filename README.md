# From Monte Carlo to Sensitivity Analysis and Metamodels
Upload input-output datasets from Monte Carlo simulations and perform sensitivity analysis and construct metamodels

## Sensitivity analysis with no sampling requirements
The applied sensitivity analysis, TOM, does not require a specific sampling strategy.  
Get visual overview on how much the model inputs affect each output parameter.

## Use metamodels to estimate input space more thoroughly
Train neural networks for individual, or all, outputs. These fast metamodels can be make additional predictions within the multi-dimensional input space. Or used to run optimization.

## Work online, using Google drive, or run locally
